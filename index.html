          <p class="ml s">
            <strong>Facebook Instant Articles / Apple News </strong> - Both of these platforms were released during my time at Shortlist Media.

          <p class="ml s">
            <strong>Open Source</strong> - Part of my role as a codebar organiser is maintaining the repos. Everything we have built is Open Source, from the planner to the tutorials. We encourage students to contribute and to help with this we run "24 Pull Requests" (see below) every December. I have also created tutorials and guides to aid new developers, such as several Intro to Python tutorials and an <a href="https://github.com/KimberleyCook/git-commands">everyday git command</a> guide.
