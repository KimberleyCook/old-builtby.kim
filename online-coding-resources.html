            <h1 class="heading">Free Online Coding Resources</h1>
             <p>I have been asked many times about good online free coding resources. I pretty much have an email that I copy and paste to this question so thought I'd put it online for everyone to look at. I have categorised them into videos, courses, games and tasks/problem solving as I know everyone learns differently. Then below I mention what languages it covers.</p>
             <p>These are all resources I have used or know that people have used. I am aware there are tonnes more so don't hate on me if one you love isn't here. It is Open Source so you could do a <a href="">PR</a> and add it üòú.</p>
